# Basic-Security-Device

## What the program does?

The program takes a string of any length and using a finite state machine checks if you enter the correct sequence of digits (0-9) to unlock/lock the program.

## How to build and run executable

Since this is a Python program you can but don't need to build it. You only need to execute it which is done in Windows 11 by going to the git clone folder -> entering the folder "Python" -> right click in the folder -> open in terminal -> type "python device.py" you can also open terminal in the main folder and type "python Python/device.py". This is also assuming you already have python installed if not this program was made from [python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/)
